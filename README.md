Discount Calculator Program
üìå Description

This program calculates the final price of an item after applying a discount.
The discount is only applied if the discount percentage is 20% or higher.
If the discount is less than 20%, the original price is returned.

‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

The program defines a function that:

Checks if the discount is 20% or higher.

If yes, it calculates the discounted price.

Otherwise, it returns the original price.

The user is prompted to enter:

The original price of the item.

The discount percentage.

The program calculates the final price and prints:

The discounted price if the discount is applied.

Otherwise, the original price.

üñ•Ô∏è Example Run

If the original price is 100 and the discount is 25%, the final price will be 75.00.

If the original price is 200 and the discount is 10%, no discount is applied, and the price remains 200.00.
